# result, and this group may not be modified. Group 2 contains the
# two programs that check your environment and installation.
# Additional benchmark groups are for test purposes only, for
# convenience of the benchmark user, and may be modified. These are
# located in the 'user' file.

# Default validity check codes
# The data send to the console window is also used for verification. The
# way this is done is governed by a set of verification rules. Each line
# written to Context.out has a rule associated with it. The rules are
# coded thus:
# 0 - Validity checking is not performed at all.
# 1 - Validity check all the data
# 2 - Remove '/' and '\' characters before validity checking.
# 3 - Remove numbers before validity checking.
# 4 - Rules 2 and 3 together.
